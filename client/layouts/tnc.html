			<h3>2. Definitions</h3>

			<p>SortVille acts only as an online destination where buyers of entertainment (the "Host(s)") and performers (the "Artist(s)", and collectively with the Hosts refered to herein as the "Member(s)") may find each other and agree to terms whereby Hosts pay Artists for their live performance (such live performance refered to herein as the “Engagement(s)”). </p>
			
			<p>SortVille assumes no liability hereunder and, in furtherance thereof and for the benefit of SortVille, Enterprise, it is agreed that neither Host nor Artist will name or join SortVille, or any of its officers, directors, principals, agents, employees and/or representatives as a party in any civil action or suit anywhere in the world, arising out of, in connection with, or related to any acts or commission or ommission pursuant to or in connection with Host’s or Artist’s use of SortVille or the Engagements contemplated herein. As is the case with sites of this kind, we have limited control over the quality, safety or legality of the services advertised.</p>
			
			<p>In the unlikely event there is a dispute, we require SortVille Artists to comply with our resolution process. Artists and Hosts permit us to make a final decision, in our sole discretion, on any claim that a buyer files with SortVille under the SortVille Event Entertainment Protection Policy. We strongly encourage Hosts to work with Artists before opening a claim relating to the booking of an Engagement. Hosts and Artists agree to follow the requirements of the SortVille Entertainment Event Protection Policy outlined in section 21.0 with respect to claims. SortVille protection covers only claims filed in accordance with the SortVille Entertainment Event Policy. We may suspend the SortVille Event Entertainment Protection Policy without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the program. We reserve the right to fix any processing errors we discover. We will correct any processing errors by debiting or crediting the payment method used for the erroneous SortVille refund or reimbursement.</p>
